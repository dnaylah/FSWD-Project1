# Full Stack Web Development

## Project 1

This project shows a list of my favorite movies and allows the user to see a trailer of the movies in the same tab. 

The user needs to locate the directory where the program has been downloaded. From there, the user can use either the terminal or python IDLE to run the module.

From the terminal, run the command (without paranthesis) 'python entertainment_center.py'.

From python IDLE, type (without the paranthesis) 'entertainment_center.py' to run the module.

Click on the movie poster image and a YouTube trailer will pop up playing a trailer of the movie. The user can then watch the trailer or exit out and choose another. The trailer can be exited by clicking outside of it on the screen.
