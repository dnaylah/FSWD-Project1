## Project 1

This project shows a list of my favorite movies and allows the user to see a trailer of the movies in the same tab. 

The user simply has to go to the site and everything will be dynamically created.

Click on the movie poster image and a YouTube trailer will pop up playing a trailer of the movie. The user can then watch the trailer or exit out and choose another. The trailer can be exited by clicking outside of it on the screen.
